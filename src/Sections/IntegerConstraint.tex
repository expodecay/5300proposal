\section{Integer Constraint Problems}
    One of the many types of problems that can be solved by 
    branch-and-bound are Integer Constraint Problems. 
    Integer Constraint Problems at their core are combinatorial 
    optimization problems, thus can be solved by branch-and-bound.
    For this example we will use a system of linear equations problem,
    apply an integer constraint, and show how it can be solved using 
    branch-and-bound. In the example below we focus on the case of 
    two equations, but this can be expanded and solved by branch-and-bound.

	\textbf{\underline{System of Linear Equations Problem}:}\\
	\underline{Instance}: \\ $Z = f(x,y)$  \\ $h(x,y) \leq c_1$ \\ $g(x,y) \leq c_2 $ \\
	\underline{Question}: What is the best assignment of $x$ and $y$ such that $Z$ is maximized?
    \\

        \subsubsection{Creating an Upper-Bound}
        First thing we must notice about Integer Constraint problems is that
        their solution space is smaller than their continuous counterparts and 
        is in fact a subset.
        We can exploit this and create an upper-bound. To create the upper bound
        we will relax the integer constraint and solve the relaxed problem.
        Solving the system of equations we get some optimimal values: $x^{'}$, $y^{'}$, 
        and $Z^{'}$. We notice that the integer constraint solution
        space is a subset of the relaxed solution space, therefore the largest
        possible value of $Z$ when applying the integer constraint is 
        $ Z = \lfloor Z^{'} \rfloor$. This will now be our upper-bound ($UP$), which can be used
        to find the optimimal solution.

        \subsubsection{Combinations}
        Now we need to turn our problem into a combinatorial optimization problem.
        To do this, we need to notice that, graphically, the solution in the continuous space is at 
        the intersection of the two lines. Therefore, when applying the integer constraint our
        solution will be near the intercention. To generate all the solution combinations we will 
        use two operations, the floor ($\lfloor \rfloor$) and ceiling ($\lceil \rceil$) operation. 
        For example, take the solution pair in the continuous space $x^{'}$ and $y^{'}$,
        applying the floor and ceiling,to each we get the canidate integer constraint solutions:  
        $(\lceil x^{'} \rceil, \lceil y^{'} \rceil)$, $(\lfloor x^{'} \rfloor, \lceil y^{'} \rceil)$
        $(\lceil x^{'} \rceil, \lfloor y^{'} \rfloor)$, $(\lfloor x^{'} \rfloor, \lfloor y^{'} \rfloor)$.
        Each floor and ceil operation that we do will be a new constraint or equation on the problem,
        and can be represented in the following form $x \leq c_i$ or $x \geq c_i$. 
        Each time a new branch is created every previous constraint on that path is 
        considered in the calculation of it's variables.

        \subsubsection{Algorithm}
        There are many ways to solve this problem using branch-and-bound.
        One way is make an algorithm that utilizes a system of equations solver in the continuous space.
        Then at each branch apply a new constraint/equation, and have the solver compute the maximum value.

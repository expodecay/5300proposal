\section{Conclusion}
	The branch-and-bound framework is an old technique that has proven to be extremely useful even when applied to new technology. The technique acts as a recipe for handling issues encountered in combinatorial optimization problems by helping the user make informed decisions when applying matrix reductions or producing lower bounds with which to branch on. However, though the general algorithm can be used in a wide range of problems, it is still up to the user to determine which sub-routine is most beneficial for the problem at hand. This relies on experience and trial-and-error, but when used properly can produce exception results.

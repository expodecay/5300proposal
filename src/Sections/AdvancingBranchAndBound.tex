\section{Advancing Branch And Bound}
	The three main components of Algorithm \ref{alg: pseudocode} (searching, pruning and branching) are generally left unspecified and interchanged by the user.
	Each of these areas has a significant impact on performance and substantial research has been done to develop them individually even though the branch-and-bound framework has remained largely unchanged. 
	Three viable research directions that can improve performance further are, the formulation of new search strategies, an analysis of how branching affects search and verification phases, and the development of a unified pruning rules. 
	Most work has been focused on the development of pruning rules which has improved the verification phase significantly, however branching and searching strategies remain open for refinement \cite{morrison2016branch}. 
	In the following sections we examine modern techniques in quantum computing and explore how they can be applied to the branch-and-bound framework to increase the search time of NP-complete problems.

\section{Basic Idea Behind BnB}
	The branch-and-bound framework is a set of techniques that encapsulates a family of algorithms that share a common solution procedure. 
	The pseudo-code for a general branch-and-bound paradigm can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg: pseudocode} where, for an optimization problem $\mathscr{P}=(X,f)$, $X$ is the search space of valid solutions and $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the objective function. 
	The goal is to find an optimal solution $x^* \in argmin_{x\in X}f(x)$ by allowing the framework to incrementally move through a decision tree $T$.
	A incumbent solution $\hat{x}\in X$ is stored globally and at each iteration, the algorithm selects a new branch $S\subseteq X$ to explore from a list $L$ of unexplored sub-problems. 
	If a candidate incumbent $\hat{x}'\in S$ is found to have a better objective value than $\hat{x}$, i.e., $f(\hat{x}') < f(\hat{x})$, then the incumbent solution is updated and that solution branch is retained for further investigation.
	However, if it is found that $\forall x \in X, f(x) \geq f(\hat{x})$, then the sub-problem is pruned. 
	Otherwise, child sub-problems are generated by partitioning $S$ into a set of sub-problems $S_1, S_2 \dots ,S_r$ which are inserted into the tree.
	When the set of unexplored sub-problems is exhausted ($L = \emptyset$), the best incumbent is returned. 
	Since sub-problems are discarded if they contain no solution better than $\hat{x}$, it must be the case that $\hat{x} = x^*$ \cite{morrison2016branch, huang2021branch,virdi2020development}.

					\If{$S$ cannot be pruned}
					\State Partition $S$ into $S_1, S_2 \dots ,S_r$
					\State Insert $S_1, S_2 \dots ,S_r$ into $L$
					\EndIf
					\State Remove $S$ from $L$
				\EndWhile
				\State \Return $\hat{x}$

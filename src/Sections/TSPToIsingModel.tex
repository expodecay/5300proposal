\section{Traveling Salesman Problem To Ising Model}
	Recent interest in solving NP-complete and NP-hard problems via adiabatic quantum optimization has led to convenient transformations of Ising formulations. 
	The idea is that if one problem has a quantum Hamiltonian $H_p$ whose ground state energy encodes the solution to a problem of interest, and another Hamiltonian $H_0$, whose ground state is "easy" to find and prepare, then we can prepare the system to be in the ground state of $H_0$ before adiabatically changing it in terms of $H_p$ for a time $T$ \cite{lucas2014ising}. 
	So long as $T$ is large enough and $H_0$ and $H_p$ do not commute, the system should remain in the resulting ground state for all time. 
	Therefore, measuring the ground state of the system at time $T$ will return a solution to the problem of interest. 
	Though there has been debate on the practicality of such a method, there has been extensive effort in finding formulations of various NPC and NPH problems in terms of Ising models. 
	Here we present one such transformation and show how it can be used to improve the computation time of a generic Branch-and-Bound technique.
